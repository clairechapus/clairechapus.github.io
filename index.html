<p>Hello World! My name is Claire Chapus, and I am a senior at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, expected to graduate in May 2021. I'm originally from the Pacific 
Palisades in Los Angeles, California, where I enjoy spending time with my family and 
going for walks on the beach. At UW, I am studying Retail and Consumer Behavior and 
will be receiving certificates in Digital Studies and Entrepreneurship. 
My passions include traveling, cooking dinner with friends, and studying digital media.
This is my web page for LIS 351. Check it out!</p>
